                            The major highlight of the smart card technology is the security it affords users. With the smart card, users can store personal information like bank records, student identity to access exclusive libraries, company identity cards to gain access through computerized security checkpoints, storing phone contacts as in sim cards and many other huge benefits that guarantee the security of personal data. 

Shopping is being made easy as the need for cash dissipates into scarcity and the portability of making payments
 go viral. Smart cards have come to stay and will form a major part of our tech lives for years to come.
