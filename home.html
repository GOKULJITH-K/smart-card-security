                            We live in a smart world where technological trends and advancement are making life easier for everyone 
                            Smart cards are providing a safer and secure means of conducting financial transactions.
                            Smart cards are now common in every economy across the world - they are being used by almost everyone that receives a paycheck. The idea of a smart card is to reduce the archaic manner in which people carry cash about and feel insecure owing to prying eyes and numerous cases of heists associated with moving large chunks of cash about. 
                            
                            Essentially, smart cards are providing a safer and secure means of conducting financial transactions while making life easier in a world that is going cashless

                        <p>
                            A smart card, chip card, or integrated circuit card (ICC or IC card) is a physical electronic authorization device, used to control access to a resource. It is typically a plastic credit card-sized card with an embedded integrated circuit (IC) chip.[1] Many smart cards include a pattern of metal contacts to electrically connect to the internal chip. Others are contactless, and some are both. Smart cards can provide personal identification, authentication, data storage, and application processing.[2] Applications include identification, financial, mobile phones (SIM), public transit, computer security, schools, and healthcare. Smart cards may provide strong security authentication for 
                            single sign-on (SSO) within organizations. Numerous nations have deployed smart cards throughout their populations.
